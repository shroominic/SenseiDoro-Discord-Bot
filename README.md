How it works
------------

With Sensei Doro, you can easily manage your study group using the Pomodoro Technique.
Simply use the `/create` command to set up a study group, and then use the `ðŸš€ START` button to begin a study session.
The bot will automatically mute all members of the group and start a countdown timer.
When the timer is up, the bot will unmute all members and start a break timer.
This cycle will continue until there are no repetitions left.
You can use the `STOP` button to end the study session at any time.
Plus, with the ability to adjust work and break times and the number of repetitions,
you can customize your study sessions to fit your needs.

The Idea
--------

The **Pomodoro Technique** is a time management method that helps boost productivity by `working for 25 minutes` and taking a `5 minute break`.
Sensei Doro brings this technique to Discord, allowing users to create a study group and track work and break times using a timer.
The bot also allows for **group study**, with all members being automatically muted during work time to create a quiet, distraction-free environment.
Users can customize their study sessions with **adjustable work and break times** and the ability to start and stop sessions at any time.

Commands
--------

You can interact with the bot using discord `/` slash commands.
