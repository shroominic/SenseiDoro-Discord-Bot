Privacy Policy
--------------

### Usage of Data

The bot may use stored data, as defined below, for different features including but not limited to: Creating different Study Sessions, Voting and command handling.  
No usage of data outside the aforementioned cases will happen and the data is not shared with any 3rd-party site or service.

### Stored Information

The bot may store the following information automatically when being invited to a new Discord Server:

- `guild_id` with the Server's ID as value.
- `guild_name` with the Server's Name as value.
- `role_admin` with Servers default role as value.
- `role_mod` with Servers default role as value.

No other information outside the above-mentioned one will be stored.

### Updating Data

The data may be updated when using specific commands.  
Updating data will require the input of an end user, and data that can be seen as sensitive, such as content of a message, may need to be stored when using certain commands.

No other actions may update the stored information at any given time.

### Temporarily stored Information

The Bot may keep the stored information in an internal caching mechanic for a certain amount of time.  
After this time period, the cached information will be dropped and only be re-added when required.

Data may be dropped from cache pre-maturely through actions such as removing the bot from the Server.

### Removal of Data

#### Automatic removal

Stored Data can be removed automatically through means of removing the bot from a Server. This can be achieved by either kicking or banning the bot from the server. Re-inviting the bot will add the same default values, as mentioned above, back to the bots database.

#### Manual removal

Manual removal of the data can be requested through email at <grasps_paradox0n@icloud.com> .  
For security reasons will we ask you to provide us with proof of ownership of the server, that you wish the data to be removed of. Only a server owner may request manual removal of data and requesting it will result in the bot being removed from the server, if still present on it.

!!! info "Technical limitations"
The automatic removal of data has certain limitations that we cannot fix or avoid.  
Limitations include, but aren't limited to, downtime of the bot due to maintenance or technical issues at our hosting provider or Discord Inc.

In such events can you request #Manual-Removal through email under the above-mentioned conditions.
